            "(CNN)  -- There was no mistaking the target: the eight huge cooling towers at Ratcliffe-on-Soar power station, sending plumes of steam high into the watery blue sky of the English Midlands. A mix of peaceful protest and direct action took place at Ratcliffe-on-Soar, England. Instead the question in the minds of an estimated 1,000 protestors gathered in the surrounding woods and scrubland was how could they get in and shut it down. Surrounded by electrified fences, coils of razor wire and hundreds of police, this coal-fired power station run by German energy firm E.On was the target of environmental activists campaigning to stop climate change. Organizers of the protest, an amorphous group called the Camp for Climate Action, claim the plant is one of the UK's largest sources of CO2 emissions and had named last weekend's protest, \"The Great Climate Swoop\". \"Climate change is one of the most important and urgent problems facing us,\" one protestor called Emma, told CNN. \"Our politicians are not doing enough. We have to take action.\" \"We need to increase the pressure on [UK prime minister] Gordon Brown until he changes his mind about coal,\" said another called Magoo. \"I wouldn't be here if I thought we couldn't make a difference today.\" Many protestors were upbeat following a recent decision by E.On to shelve plans for a new coal powered power station at Kingsnorth, in southern England, and the site of a similar protest in 2008. E.On told CNN that the decision was \"purely economic\", and \"due to a marked fall in demand for electricity during the recession\", although many activists were claiming it as a victory for them. Determination to act There was no doubting the activists' dedication. The weekend began peacefully enough with a procession snaking up from the East Midlands Parkway train station accompanied by a pedal-powered sound-system and a band. Several officers told CNN they were glad to be policing this event rather than a local football derby on the same day. Yet over 24-hours police say 57 protestors were arrested and both police and activists were injured in violent scuffles. The protest at Ratcliffe-on-Soar was the latest from a movement that has quickly come to define environmental activism in Britain, mixing elements of the mid-1990s road protest movement with the more targeted, professional approach of groups like Greenpeace and the mass civil disobedience modeled by the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. Although leaderless and non-hierarchical it has shown determination, organization and direction. There were several families with young children at the protests, as well as individuals of all ages, although the bulk were twenty- and thirty-somethings. While some wore bandanas to hide their faces, others were in dressed as clowns or scarecrows and seemed content to picnic within sight of the plant. Peaceful protest and police In the spring James Hansen a climate modeler for NASA and prominent scientist lent his support for direct action, telling The Guardian newspaper: \"The democratic process doesn't quite seem to be working... I think that peaceful demonstration is not out of order, because we're running out of time.\" The first action by Climate Camp for Climate Action was at Drax coal power station in 2006, followed by Heathrow airport in 2007 and Kingsnorth coal power station in 2008. In 2009 there have already been three events: a protest at the European Climate Exchange in London, to coincide with the G20; a camp on Blackheath, London, in August -- the site of the 1381 Peasant's Revolt - and now the protests at Ratcliffe. All have been characterized by a mix of peaceful protest around a \"camp\" that is intended to model low-carbon living, alongside militant direct action - and an increasingly tense relationship with police. At Kingsnorth a huge police presence carried out over 8,000 searches according to an official report by the National Policing Improvement Agency, which also criticized tactics as \"disproportionate and counterproductive\".

            "(CNN)  -- Thierry Henry could face FIFA disciplinary action over his handball which helped France to qualify for the finals of the 2010 World Cup at the expense of Ireland. FIFA president Sepp Blatter told reporters in Cape Town that the Barcelona striker's \"blatant unfair play\" could land him in hot water. \"The FIFA disciplinary committee will open an investigation ... concerning the behavior of the player Thierry Henry,\" he said. \"It was blatant unfair play and was seen all around the world. I don't know the outcome of the disciplinary committee, let them make the decision. \"Fair play must be maintained in our game.\" Blatter was speaking after an extraordinary meeting of the FIFA executive committee, which was convened to consider the refereeing controversy in the France - Ireland match, incidents surrounding the Algeria - Egypt playoff tie and matchfixing in Europe. It had been widely trailed that the FIFA executive would sanction the use of two extra officials behind both goal lines in World Cup. But Blatter said that the finals in South Africa was too soon to introduce the system which has been used in the second-tier European club tournament this year. \"The experiments with the Europa League shall go on into the knockout stages next year but it has been decided, for the World Cup 2010, there is no change in the refereeing: one referee, two assistants and a fourth official.\" He went on to say that there would be further investigation into both video technology and additional referees. \"We shall have a look at technology or additional persons and this shall be done by a committee but not the referees committee alone, it will be done by the football, technical and medical committees, too,\" he added. Ireland were denied a place in the finals by a goal that should have been disallowed because Henry used his hand to control the ball before setting up William Gallas to score the aggregate decider in the second leg in the Stade de France. Ireland subsequently launched two appeals, the first for the match to be replayed, the second for them to be added to the line-up for the finals as the 33rd team. Both have been rejected, but Blatter was forced to apologize to the Irish for making public their supposedly private bid to be included as an extra team. Blatter put their request into the public domain in light-hearted comments made in Johannesburg, which left Irish football officials infuriated and insulted. \"I would like to express my regrets for the wrong interpretation of what I said. I regret what I have created and I'm sorry to the Ireland football confederation for these headlines going around the world,\" he said. \"It's a pity I communicated in this way. Sorry again.\"\n",

            "(CNN)  -- This Twitter thing has been coming on like gangbusters. The messaging site has been around for a couple of years, but its popularity seems to have exploded just recently. A self-admitted tech geek, Chris Pirillo is president of Lockergnome.com, a blogging network. Everyone from BarackObama to John Cleese to NASA to the consulate of Israel has a Twitter account. Heck, even yours truly does! Do you? Follow me and I'll follow you back. Twitter is really more of a social commons than a full-blown social network like MySpace or Facebook. It pretty much does one thing: allows people to \"tweet\" what they're up to (or what they're thinking about) in 140 characters or less. Call it micro-blogging, if you will, but it's about as close to the \"Keep It Simple, Stupid\" (K.I.S.S.) ideal as it gets. People can follow your tweets and you can follow theirs -- that's pretty much it. There are some third-party apps out there that can help you organize and seek out the information flying around out there in the Twittersphere, but it all pretty much stays in the nutshell. With the overwhelming amount of widgets and gadgets and gizmos and doohickeys and whatnots attached to every other social network out there, isn't it nice to be able to get away with plain ol' simple every now and again? Since we're sticking with the \"less is more\" aesthetic, I'm just going to give you 10 Twitter tips instead of the 20 I could have stretched this into. You're welcome! 1. Be yourself, but beware. Say whatever you feel like saying, but remember that whatever you write could exist in the digital universe forever. Proceed with extreme caution. 2. Don't be afraid to interact with others. If you like something they say, reply by clicking the little grey arrow that appears when you hover over one of their tweets. You can also simply type in @username (replacing \"username\" with whatever their username happens to be on Twitter). This is the formal way to address someone on Twitter. iReport.com: Do you agree with these tips? Share some of yours 3. Follow celebrities. They may never interact with you, but at least you can interact with them. It's no longer a question of who is on Twitter -- but who ISN'T on Twitter. 4. Use Twitter from your desktop. Twitter has something called an API (Application Programming Interface), which allows programmers to create experiences around Twitter for the community. Because of this, there have been an amazing array of applications released that will allow you to manage your Twitter account easily. There's Twitterrific, TweetDeck, and Twhirl -- just to name a few. 5. Find friends fast. If you're looking for new friends, a quick search for some of your favorite things on search.twitter.com will quickly reveal who you should be friending on Twitter. Maybe they'll follow you back? 6. Follow government officials. If your elected official isn't on http://tweetcongress.org, then they're behind the times. Heck, even the Library of Congress is on Twitter! 7. Crowdsource. If you have an idea, or a question, don't hold it in -- let it be known to all! Who knows -- someone just may answer your call for help. 8. Tweetups. Keep your eye out for these things. They're meetups for people on Twitter, and there's likely one happening regularly in your neck of the woods. I've taken to hosting one monthly in the Seattle area, as a matter of fact. Meet Twitter people -- tweeps, tweeple -- in meatspace! 9. Retweet. If you like something that someone else has tweeted, you can \"RT\" (retweet) it. This gives the original person credit, and also lets your followers know what you like. That's community! 10. Go with the flow. If you think you know better than everybody else, you're wrong -- the\n",

Footage from the event showed Enke's flower-bedecked coffin carried through the stadium to the accompaniment of Bette Midler's song \"The Rose\" as the crowd cheered. Many of the spectators waved Hannover 96 banners as they wiped tears from their eyes. Enke, 32, was the goalkeeper for both Hannover 96 and the German national soccer team. He died Tuesday about 6:25 p.m. after he apparently stepped in front of a train. He had played in eight games for the team and was widely expected to be the German team's goalkeeper in the 2010 World Cup. \"Preliminary police investigations indicate a suicide,\" Hannover 96 spokesman Stefan Wittke said last week. The stadium funeral service followed another memorial in a church and a mourning march through Hannover initiated by fans, the team said in a statement on its Web site. \"Robert's wife Teresa has expressed the wish to have all his friends and fans of her deceased husband bid farewell to him in the AWD Arena,\" the statement said. \"Hannover 96 supports Teresa Enke in her wish to have Robert and his friends, fans and teammates part with one another in an appropriate and worthy setting.\" \"A few days have passed since Robert's tragic death, but our inner shock remains,\" the team said. \"One thing is certain: We are not alone in our sadness. Robert Enke was not only perceived by you as a successful football player but above all as a special human being.\" Funeral speakers included German football league president Theo Zwanziger, the team said, as well as team chairman Martin Kind and other dignitaries. Afterward, the team said Enke would be laid to rest \"in the presence of (his) closest family members.\" Teresa Enke told reporters following Enke's death that her husband had been battling depression for six years, but had kept his condition from being public knowledge. He left a suicide note, she said. The Enkes' biological daughter, Lara, died in 2006 at the age of 2 from a heart condition. The couple recently had adopted an 18-month-old girl they named Leila. \"I tried to be there for him, said that football is not everything,\" Teresa Enke said. \"There are many beautiful things in life. It is not hopeless. \"We had Lara, we have Leila,\" she said. \"I always wanted to help him get through it. He didn't want (the depression) to come out because of fear.

He was the deputy director of the group Daryeel Bulasho Guud (DBG), funded by a German company and affiliated with the group Bread for the World. Qeyre was shot in the Somali capital of Mogadishu Friday night in what appeared to be a targeted attack, the reports said. He was shot by three gunmen outside the facility where aid distribution is coordinated. The gunmen may have been staking out the facility waiting for Qeyre to exit. The head of DBG, in Nairobi, Kenya, said he will suspend all aid operations in Somalia for the time being. The second fatality was a member of the Sodra nongovernmental organization, which is helping with humanitarian efforts in Somalia. Officials said it appears that Ali Baashi was also specifically targeted by gunmen. Earlier this week, the World Food Program said a truck driver carrying its relief supplies was killed -- the fourth WFP driver killed in Somalia this year. Ahmed Saalim was shot when fighting broke out between convoy escorts and militiamen at a checkpoint, the U.N. aid agency said. A growing percentage of the Somali population has become dependent on humanitarian aid. A severe famine swept the nation in 1991-1993, devastating crops, killing up to 280,000 people and displacing up to 2 million, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. The situation has been exacerbated by drought, continual armed conflicts in central and southern Somalia and high inflation on food and fuel. Journalist Mohamed Amin contributed to this report.\n",

            "(CNN)  -- Three protesters scaled the Golden Gate Bridge Monday and unfurled a \"Free Tibet\" banner, a likely precursor to large protests when the Olympic torch arrives Wednesday in San Francisco, California. Members of Students for a Free Tibet climbed the bridge to place these banners, said the group's spokesman. The banner read, \"One World. One Dream. Free Tibet.\" Those who climbed cables from which the bridge is suspended are members of Students for a Free Tibet, said group spokesman Tenzin Dasang. The three were arrested along with four others at the site. All seven were charged with felony conspiracy and misdemeanor nuisance, said California Highway Patrol Officer Mary Ziegenbein. The climbers also were charged with misdemeanor trespassing.  Watch protesters and banner hung from bridge » The incident forced the closure of one northbound lane of the bridge. The climbers -- who were on the bridge for about three hours -- came down voluntarily about 1:15 p.m. (4:15 p.m. ET) after workers with the Golden Gate Bridge District began cutting down their banner, Ziegenbein said. Dasang said he has heard of many people planning to protest in San Francisco against China's human rights record. \"We want it to be peaceful. But it will be large,\" said Dasang, 22, during a phone interview in which he said he was near the bridge. \"I heard from Tibetans that now live all over the U.S. and even abroad who are coming here.\" The Olympic flame is on a 130-day journey that will take it through 23 cities on five continents and then throughout China, culminating at the Olympics opening ceremony in Beijing August 8. The San Francisco protest comes the same day as a demonstration in Paris, France, disrupted the torch relay many times. In Paris, police had to cut the Olympic torch relay short Monday amid protests against China's human rights record, French police said. The torch was scheduled to travel 17 miles, past Paris City Hall, but that stop and others were called off after the protests. The torch made it through about 10 miles of its scheduled journey. It was then driven by bus to its final destination, where it was displayed again during a public ceremony at a stadium. Authorities had to play hide-and-seek with the Olympic torch during much of the route, placing it on a bus at least twice during a sometimes chaotic relay route. China has come under international criticism because of its crackdown last month on protesters calling for democratic freedoms and self-rule in Tibet and neighboring Chinese provinces. Protesters have said more than 100 people have died in the crackdown, but Beijing denies that and has accused supporters of the Dalai Lama of orchestrating the violence. U.S. and other Western leaders have called on China to provide civil rights and freedoms to those in Tibet and to enter peaceful discussions aimed at resolving the crisis.  E-mail to a friend\n",

Willard Boyle, left, and George Smith handle a charge-coupled device in 1974. Charles K. Kao, a British and U.S. citizen, won for \"groundbreaking achievements concerning the transmission of light in fibers for optical communication.\" Willard S. Boyle, a Canadian and U.S. citizen, and George E. Smith, a U.S. citizen, \"invented the first successful imaging technology using a digital sensor, a CCD (Charge-Coupled Device).\" Kao in 1966 \"made a discovery that led to a breakthrough in fiber optics. He carefully calculated how to transmit light over long distances via optical glass fibers,\" the academy said in a press release. Today, \"optical fibers make up the circulatory system that nourishes our communication society\" and \"facilitate broadband communication such as the Internet,\" the academy said. Boyle and Smith's Charge-Coupled Device -- invented in 1969 -- \"is the digital camera's electronic eye\" and paved the way for digital photography. \"It revolutionized photography, as light could now be captured electronically instead of on film. The digital form facilitates the processing and distribution of these images. CCD technology is also used in many medical applications, e.g. imaging the inside of the human body, both for diagnostics and for microsurgery.\" The Nobel Prizes are being awarded this week and next. The medicine award was handed out on Monday. The prizes for chemistry and literature will be awarded Wednesday and Thursday.

I have not been true to my values and the behavior my family deserves,\" he said in a statement on his official Web site. \"I am not without faults and I am far short of perfect. I am dealing with my behavior and personal failings behind closed doors with my family. Those feelings should be shared by us alone.\" Woods made the comments in a statement posted on his Web site the same day that a gossip magazine published a story alleging that Woods had an affair with a 24-year-old New York cocktail waitress. The nightclub hostess, identified by a supermarket tabloid as Tiger Woods' mistress had called allegations that she is romantically involved with the golf superstar false and \"ridiculous.\" In an interview published Tuesday, Rachel Uchitel told The New York Post that a disgruntled acquaintance sold the story to the National Enquirer and that \"not a word of it is true.\" \"I work in clubs, and I am a businesswoman,\" Uchitel said. \"I do not have sex with celebrities, and I have not had an affair with Tiger Woods.\" Speculation has swirled around Woods since a wreck outside his Florida home early Friday left him with minor injuries and a citation for careless driving. The Florida Highway Patrol said Tuesday that its citation closes its investigation of the crash. Woods was not required to talk to state police about the wreck and did not sit for an interview with investigators. He issued a statement Sunday saying he alone was responsible for the crash and denouncing \"the many false, unfounded and malicious rumors that are currently circulating about my family and me.\" Opinion: Woods is only human The 33-year-old golf phenomenon has won the Masters tournament and the PGA tournament each four times, as well as three U.S. Open titles. Investigators have said they don't have details on why Woods was driving away from his home at such an early hour. A police report says the wreck was not alcohol-related. Uchitel said she has met Woods twice, once in her capacity as the VIP director at a club in Manhattan's trendy Meatpacking District and another time through a mutual friend. \"That's my job: to know these people, to have a relationship with them, to hang out with them,\" she told the Post. \"It doesn't mean I am having sex with them or an affair with them.\" She said the allegations \"must feel horrible\" to Woods' wife, Elin Nordegren. \"The worst part of it, it's not true,\" Uchitel said.\n",

Dilshan made 109 as Sri Lanka, seeking a win to level the series at 1-1, closed on 366 for eight wickets on the opening day. All-rounder Angelo Mathews was closing on his first Test century with an unbeaten 86 on a wicket offering turn and bounce, but was rapidly running out of partners to the second new ball. India, who won the second Test in Kanpur last week by a crushing innings and 144 runs, will take over from South Africa as the top-ranked Test team in the world if they can win the series 2-0. Off-spinner Harbhajan Singh claimed four victims and slow left-armer Pragyan Ojha two but Dilshan proved a formidable opponent. He continued his superb 2009 with 10 boundaries and two sixes to reach three figures for the 11th time in Tests. He made 112 in the high-scoring draw in the first Test in Ahmedabad. Dilshan put on 93 in 20 overs for the first wicket with Tharanga Paranavitana, who made 53.before becoming Harbhajan's first victim just before lunch. India claimed three wickets in the afternoon as Sri Lankan captain Kumar Sangakkara went cheaply with Mahela Jayawardene adding 59 for the third wicket before falling victim to paceman Shanthakumaran Sreesanth. Harbhajan had Thilan Samaraweera caught in the leg-trap for one just before the tea interval. Mathews and Dilshan put Sri Lanka back on top again in the final session with a 74 stand which was ended when the opener was given out caught at short-leg off Harbhajan, with TV replays indicating he was unlucky.

            "(CNN)  -- To guard against public indifference to climate change the United Nations has enlisted a coalition of the world's leading advertising agencies. The world in their hands: New campaign aims to empower public. Leading up to the U.N. Climate Change Conference (COP15) in Copenhagen in December, the global \"Hopenhagen\" campaign has been unveiled. The initiative is aiming to generate active interest and persuade the public into believing they have a say in the negotiations between world leaders that will ratify a new global climate treaty. \"Climate change is one of the epic challenges facing this and future generations. World leaders will come together for the Copenhagen climate change conference in December, and every citizen of the world has a stake in the outcome. It is time to seal a deal. We need a global movement that mobilizes real change,\" said U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in a press statement. \"It is about global action for a global climate treaty and a better future for humankind.\" The campaign is a collaboration between a number of the world's largest communications companies. The strategy and creative concept for the Hopenhagen idea came from WPP's Ogilvy & Mather team; digital framework and direction were developed by MDC Partners' Colle+McVoy; and the global PR and messaging plans are spearheaded by Omnicom Group's Ketchum. Michael Lee, executive director of the International Advertising Association called the coalition of media companies involved \"unprecedented,\" adding that it was \"testament to the significance the industry places on the need for action to address climate change.\" According to the campaign brief, the aim is to change from the idea that we are just \"coping\" with global climate challenges to \"hoping\" and ultimately acting to combat the perils of climate change. The Hopenhagen Web site will be the center of an open source campaign where the public can send messages to the delegates of the UN summit meeting as well as raise awareness and debate issues. While the Web site will be developed as the months go by, the IAA also hopes that businesses, governments and NGOs engage in the campaign as well to create a broad global community with shared goals. Unveiled at the Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival this week, the first elements of the campaign can be seen at New York's JFK International, LA International and London Heathrow airports. From September a more \"aggressive\" consumer launch of the campaign will commence until the conference begins on December 7. What do you think?

            "\n",
            "To date, 8.1 million vehicles worldwide have been recalled by the manufacturer, with the possibility of more to come after Thursday's announcement by the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration of a formal investigation into brake problems with the 2010 Prius. \n",

            "As the company's woes continue to mount, there has been some speculation from critics such as Rep. Henry Waxman, D-California, as to whether Toyota's recent problems with sudden unintended acceleration go beyond the problems already identified. \n",
            "\n",
            "Speaking on Wednesday to CNN's Campbell Brown, Larry Webster of Popular Mechanics magazine spoke at length on the problem, saying that \"in the last decade, there have been tens of thousands of reports of sudden unintended acceleration in cars made by all the manufacturers.\" Is this true? \n",
            "\n",
            "The CNN Fact Check Desk wondered: Which other car manufacturers have had a problem with sudden unintended acceleration? \n",
            "\n",
            "• Sudden unintended acceleration occurs when a car continues to move forward, often at increasing speeds, without the driver pressing on the accelerator pedal. \n",
            "\n",
            "• While Toyota is basing its current recall on the possibility of floor mat entrapment and sticky accelerator pedals, many factors can contribute to the problem of sudden unintended acceleration in vehicles. Reports from the NHTSA have blamed it on many other factors, including frayed throttle cables and cracked cruise-control computers. \n",
            "\n",
            "• The top five manufacturers of cars driven in the United States are General Motors, Toyota, Ford, Honda and Chrysler. \n",
            "\n",
            "• The NHTSA's online database indicates that every one of these five has received numerous consumer complaints of sudden unintended acceleration in more than one of its models. Each manufacturer has faced a formal investigation into these complaints by the NHTSA and as a result has had to recall vehicles to fix various conditions that led to the problem. \n",
            "\n",
            "• Recalls due to incidents of sudden unintended acceleration are not limited to the big five manufacturers. According to the NHTSA database, recalls have also been issued for vehicles made by Nissan, BMW, Volkswagen, Mitsubishi, Subaru, Mercedes-Benz, Kia, Mazda, Land Rover, Suzuki and Volvo. \n",
            "\n",
            "• In December 2009, Consumer Reports published an article that said 41 percent of the sudden acceleration complaints received by the NHTSA in 2008 pertained to Toyota and its luxury brand, Lexus. Ford came in second behind Toyota with 28 percent of the complaints relating to U.S. models. \n",
            "\n",
            "• Bottom Line: Sudden unintended acceleration is not a problem limited to Toyota. Many car manufacturers, including the other four with the largest shares of the U.S. market, have had to recall vehicles because of this issue.\n",

            "(CNN)  -- Two former Blackwater employees have made statements against Blackwater Worldwide and its founder Erik Prince, accusing the security company and its former CEO of murder and other serious crimes in Iraq, according to court documents filed this week. Blackwater founder Erik Prince, shown here before a congressional panel in 2007, recently left the company. The sworn affidavits by an ex-Marine who joined Blackwater and another employee -- listed in the documents as \"John Doe No. 1\" and \"John Doe No. 2\" -- are part of a civil lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Virginia against Prince on behalf of Iraqi families who say they lost loved ones at the hands of his company. Blackwater, recently renamed Xe, issued a statement Tuesday, saying it would respond \"to the anonymous unsubstantiated and offensive assertions put forward by the plaintiffs,\" in a brief to be filed August 17. The company had a security contract for operations in Iraq under the U.S. State Department until May, when the federal government declined to renew the contract. The decision did not affect other contracts Blackwater has with the State Department, a senior State department official told CNN earlier this year. Several of the plaintiffs are connected to a September 2007 shooting incident in Baghdad in which the Iraqi government says security guards, then employed by Blackwater, fired upon and killed 17 Iraqi civilians. The affidavits by the two witnesses, who did not want to be identified in the court documents filed Monday for fear of retaliatory \"violence,\"  paint a menacing portrait of Prince, who recently resigned from his company. \"First, he views himself as a Christian crusader tasked with eliminating Muslims and the Islamic faith from the globe. ... Second, Mr. Prince is motivated by greed,\" says John Doe No. 2. \"He sought every opportunity to deploy men to Iraq in order to earn more money from the United States government.\" He refers to another incident when he \"first arrived in Baghdad\" in which he saw fellow employees pulling weapons out of a shipment of dog food -- the allegation being smuggling. John Doe No. 1 describes witnessing one incident in Baquba, where a Blackwater employee allegedly fired into a passing single-passenger vehicle without provocation. He says he's heard of similar instances of excessive or deadly force from other Blackwater employees. However, neither gives clear details about the incidents they describe, such as specific dates or locations. The court documents filed Tuesday are in response to a defense motion to dismiss the suit. The suit says the affidavits were also submitted to the Justice Department, which is engaged in an ongoing investigation into the Blackwater case. No criminal charges have been filed against Prince. \"It is obvious that Plaintiffs have chosen to slander Mr. Prince rather than raise legal arguments or actual facts that will be considered by a court of law. We are happy to engage them there,\" the company statement said. \"We question the judgment of anyone who relies upon and [reiterates] anonymous declarations.\" Earlier this year, five former Blackwater security guards pleaded not guilty to federal charges of manslaughter and other serious crimes stemming from a September 16, 2007, shooting. Their trial is set for February 2010.\n",

One of the injured officers is taken out of an ambulance and rushed into the University of Louisville Hospital. Vincent Windell, 22, and another man whose name was not released were in custody in connection with Thursday's shooting, Jeffersonville, Indiana, Chief Detective Charlie Thompson told CNN.

The incident began Thursday when Jeffersonville Police Cpl. Dan Lawhorn, 39, and Patrolman Keith Broady, 32, responded to a call from a Motel 6 employee about possible drug activity, Thompson said. The two were apparently ambushed when they arrived, Indiana State Police told the Louisville Courier-Journal. Lawhorn, an 11-year veteran, was shot in the leg, and Broady, a 4-year veteran, was shot in the upper body, Thompson said. The two officers returned fire, but it wasn't clear whether the suspects were hit. Lawhorn and Broady were able to reach their patrol cars and call for help after the shooting.

Shaquille O'Neal is hoping his arrival will put a smile on the faces of Cleveland fans. The 37-year-old O'Neal is one of the all-time greats of basketball, winning four NBA championships, three straight with the Los Angeles Lakers and the other with Miami Heat. James is widely recognized as the sport's current superstar, but the 24-year-old has been left frustrated by Cleveland's failure to win the title. He stormed off the court after  their loss to the Orlando Magic in the Eastern Conference finals, not even shaking hands with 2008 Olympic teammate Dwight Howard. The trade, which sees Phoenix get center Ben Wallace and guard Sasha Pavlovic, has been talked about since February but finalized on Thursday night. \"I was elated about the trade because I get to play with one of the greatest players to ever play the game in LeBron James,\" O'Neal was quoted on the NBA's official Web site www.nba.com. O'Neal averaged 17.8 points and 8.4 rebounds in 75 games for the Suns last season and believes he still has much to offer the NBA. \"My numbers are not good enough to retire. Three more years left,\" O'Neal wrote on his Twitter blog. His career averages are 24.7 points, 11.3 rebounds and 2.4 blocked shots, with his peak seasons coming as he led the Lakers to three straight titles from 2000-02. The Lakers traded him to Miami where he spent three seasons, helping them to the NBA Championship three years ago. He has played in Phoenix for the past two years, restricted by injuries in his first season. The Cavs, powered by James, won 66 regular season games and their first eight in the playoffs before coming unstuck against the Magic. They will be hoping that O'Neal will be the final piece in the jigsaw to land the first American sports championship for Cleveland in 45 years.\n",

Part of a collapsed ConAgra Foods plant lies atop parked cars Tuesday in Garner, North Carolina. Four people were in critical condition after the explosion at the ConAgra Foods plant in the town of Garner, CNN affiliate WRAL-TV reported. The explosion, reported about 11:30 a.m. Tuesday, caused sections of the roof to collapse. Search efforts for those missing were slowed by ammonia leaks and a fire that was not extinguished until afternoon. \"There was no warnings, no signs,\" Garner Mayor Ronnie Williams said. \"It all happened very abruptly.\" At least 38 people were transported to area hospitals, said Jeff Hammerstein, district chief for Wake County Emergency Medical Services. Four burn victims -- two males and two females -- were undergoing critical care at the North Carolina Jaycees Burn Center, said Dr. Charles Cairns, director of emergency medicine for UNC Hospitals. The patients suffered burns that covered from 40 to 60 percent of their bodies, Cairns said. Police said recovery workers still were trying to get the two bodies out of the plant, which makes Slim Jim food products. The victims' names weren't immediately available. More than 300 people were in the plant when the explosion happened, authorities said. The cause of the blast was unknown, according to Garner police spokesman Joe Binns. Rescuers were crawling into the rubble -- sometimes in pockets of space less than 30 inches tall -- in attempts to access the two bodies and find the missing person, officials said at a news conference Tuesday night. The search crews were moving slowly in part because the building is very unstable, officials said. Video from the scene showed holes in sections of the roof of the 425,000 square-foot plant. First responders set up a makeshift triage area near the building. A section of the roof was collapsed, and pipes could be seen spewing liquid believed to be ammonia.  Watch liquid spew from building » ConAgra Foods' brands include Healthy Choice, Chef Boyardee and Orville Redenbacher, among others. The Garner plant is known for producing Slim Jim beef jerky products. The company was \"working with authorities on the ground to ensure that their employees are getting all of the support that they need,\" said Stephanie Childs, ConAgra director of corporate communication. \"The employees' health is their only real concern at this time.\" Gail Ruffin, a ConAgra worker who was in the plant when the explosion happened, told WRAL she heard a boom. \"The ceiling start coming down, and we all start running,\" Ruffin, who wasn't injured, told WRAL. \"Everyone was trying to get to the exit door. ... I was just trying to get out, and then we just [saw] people that [were] burned -- blood all over them.\" Garner is seven miles south of Raleigh.\n",

Smoke from the explosion of a truck carrying fireworks rises over Ocracoke Island, North Carolina, Saturday. Jamie Tunnell, Hyde County spokeswoman, said the fireworks were to be used for the annual Fourth of July show on Ocracoke Island, and the five people were members of the crew setting up the display. The truck exploded at the Ocracoke Island docks. One person was killed at the scene, while another died at a hospital from injuries sustained in the blast, Tunnell said. Emergency crews and firefighters arrived. Tunnell said two volunteer firefighters were being treated for smoke inhalation and exhaustion.

            "(CNN)  -- Typhoon Morakot bore down on Taiwan Friday, packing 89 mph (143 kph) winds and threatening to soak the entire island when it makes landfall Saturday morning, Taiwan's Central Weather Bureau said. A man fights against strong winds in Hsintien, Taipei county, Taiwan, on Friday. As of 10 a.m. Friday (2 a.m. GMT), wind gusts were reaching 112 mph, and Morakot, a medium-strength typhoon, was moving west-northwest at 14 mph en route to landfall, the agency said. Already, mudslides and landslides were occurring on the land, as airlines canceled flights, and government offices, schools and the Taiwan Stock Exchange closed for the day, according to Taiwan's Central News Agency. The storm was centered about 124 miles (200 km) southeast of Taipei and could wind up directly over the capital, said CNN meteorologist Kevin Corriveau. He predicted its impact would be massive. \"This storm has already dumped about 400 millimeters (16 inches) of rain in the central and southern part of the island, and they're still expecting another 500 (20 inches) to 800 millimeters (32 inches) of rain over the next 24 to 48 hours,\" he said.  Watch how the storm is affecting life on the island » Drought in recent months has severely affected the area, leaving the ground so hard that it cannot absorb the rainfall, Corriveau said. However, the island tends to prepare well for typhoons, Corriveau added. \"They take it very seriously,\" Corriveau said. \"Just like Cuba is very good at handling hurricanes, Taiwan is very good at handling typhoons.\" On Thursday, Taiwanese Premier Liu Chao-shiuan examined the island's emergency operation center and asked all personnel to stay on high alert over the next day, with the typhoon forecast to \"affect all regions of Taiwan,\" according to CNA. Taiwan and eastern China are particularly vulnerable to flash flooding and mudslides because of the proximity of the mountains to the sea. Once it hits land, Morakot is expected to weaken to tropical storm strength, the Central Weather Bureau reported.\n",

A man fights against strong winds in Hsintien, Taipei county, Taiwan, on Friday. As of 3 a.m. local time, the storm's eye was over the northern part of the island, CNN forecaster Kevin Corriveau reported, although he noted that slow-moving Morakot is so large it encompassed the entire island. Journalist Andrew Lee in Taipei, citing local media, said the storm had blown off roofs and washed out some bridges. Corriveau said the island has received more than 39 inches (99 centimeters) of rain from the storm, which he said was expected to dump another 39 to 47 inches (99 to 119 centimeters) of rain on Taiwan. The storm made landfall carrying winds of up to 92 mph (148 km/h), with gusts up to 115 mph (185 km/h), the Joint Typhoon Warning Center said. iReport.com: See balcony view of heavy rains Corriveau said the storm was expected to linger over the island for several more hours, and the southern portion of Morakot would likely be passing over Taiwan for hours after that. The storm's impact had already been felt by Friday morning, with mudslides and landslides occurring on the island. The area has been severely affected by drought in recent months, leaving the ground so hard that it does not absorb the rainfall, Corriveau said. Taiwan's Central News Agency, acknowledging the drought, cited the Water Resources Agency as saying that the storm had replenished the island's reservoirs and would put an end to water rationing in several areas.

Canadian leader Stephen Harper says he backs President Obama's \"renewed commitment to Afghanistan.\" \"We are not going to ever defeat the insurgency,\" Stephen Harper told CNN's Fareed Zakaria in an interview that aired Sunday. \"Afghanistan has probably had -- my reading of Afghanistan history -- it's probably had an insurgency forever, of some kind.\" Harper's blunt assessment comes as nearly 2,800 Canadian forces are fighting in Afghanistan. The country's parliament has voted to pull them out by 2011. Harper spoke with Zakaria last week after a visit by President Obama, who made Canada his first foreign trip since taking office in January. Obama has said Afghanistan is the central front to the U.S.-led war on terror. The Pentagon is in the process of sending an additional 17,000 troops to Afghanistan, bringing the total there to 55,000. Harper told CNN that he supports Obama's \"renewed commitment to Afghanistan\" but said he would not recommit any more Canadian troops until there is a clear plan for leaving Afghanistan. \"What has to happen in Afghanistan is, we have to have an Afghan government that is capable of managing that insurgency and improving its own governance,\" Harper said. \"If President Obama wants anybody to do more, I would ask very hard questions about what is the strategy for success and for an eventual departure.\"\n",

            "(CNN)  -- There was no mistaking the target: the eight huge cooling towers at Ratcliffe-on-Soar power station, sending plumes of steam high into the watery blue sky of the English Midlands. A mix of peaceful protest and direct action took place at Ratcliffe-on-Soar, England. Instead the question in the minds of an estimated 1,000 protestors gathered in the surrounding woods and scrubland was how could they get in and shut it down. Surrounded by electrified fences, coils of razor wire and hundreds of police, this coal-fired power station run by German energy firm E.On was the target of environmental activists campaigning to stop climate change. Organizers of the protest, an amorphous group called the Camp for Climate Action, claim the plant is one of the UK's largest sources of CO2 emissions and had named last weekend's protest, \"The Great Climate Swoop\". \"Climate change is one of the most important and urgent problems facing us,\" one protestor called Emma, told CNN. \"Our politicians are not doing enough. We have to take action.\" \"We need to increase the pressure on [UK prime minister] Gordon Brown until he changes his mind about coal,\" said another called Magoo. \"I wouldn't be here if I thought we couldn't make a difference today.\" Many protestors were upbeat following a recent decision by E.On to shelve plans for a new coal powered power station at Kingsnorth, in southern England, and the site of a similar protest in 2008. E.On told CNN that the decision was \"purely economic\", and \"due to a marked fall in demand for electricity during the recession\", although many activists were claiming it as a victory for them. Determination to act There was no doubting the activists' dedication. The weekend began peacefully enough with a procession snaking up from the East Midlands Parkway train station accompanied by a pedal-powered sound-system and a band. Several officers told CNN they were glad to be policing this event rather than a local football derby on the same day. Yet over 24-hours police say 57 protestors were arrested and both police and activists were injured in violent scuffles. The protest at Ratcliffe-on-Soar was the latest from a movement that has quickly come to define environmental activism in Britain, mixing elements of the mid-1990s road protest movement with the more targeted, professional approach of groups like Greenpeace and the mass civil disobedience modeled by the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. Although leaderless and non-hierarchical it has shown determination, organization and direction. There were several families with young children at the protests, as well as individuals of all ages, although the bulk were twenty- and thirty-somethings. While some wore bandanas to hide their faces, others were in dressed as clowns or scarecrows and seemed content to picnic within sight of the plant. Peaceful protest and police In the spring James Hansen a climate modeler for NASA and prominent scientist lent his support for direct action, telling The Guardian newspaper: \"The democratic process doesn't quite seem to be working... I think that peaceful demonstration is not out of order, because we're running out of time.\" The first action by Climate Camp for Climate Action was at Drax coal power station in 2006, followed by Heathrow airport in 2007 and Kingsnorth coal power station in 2008. In 2009 there have already been three events: a protest at the European Climate Exchange in London, to coincide with the G20; a camp on Blackheath, London, in August -- the site of the 1381 Peasant's Revolt - and now the protests at Ratcliffe. All have been characterized by a mix of peaceful protest around a \"camp\" that is intended to model low-carbon living, alongside militant direct action - and an increasingly tense relationship with police. At Kingsnorth a huge police presence carried out over 8,000 searches according to an official report by the National Policing Improvement Agency, which also criticized tactics as \"disproportionate and counterproductive\".

            "(CNN)  -- Thierry Henry could face FIFA disciplinary action over his handball which helped France to qualify for the finals of the 2010 World Cup at the expense of Ireland. FIFA president Sepp Blatter told reporters in Cape Town that the Barcelona striker's \"blatant unfair play\" could land him in hot water. \"The FIFA disciplinary committee will open an investigation ... concerning the behavior of the player Thierry Henry,\" he said. \"It was blatant unfair play and was seen all around the world. I don't know the outcome of the disciplinary committee, let them make the decision. \"Fair play must be maintained in our game.\" Blatter was speaking after an extraordinary meeting of the FIFA executive committee, which was convened to consider the refereeing controversy in the France - Ireland match, incidents surrounding the Algeria - Egypt playoff tie and matchfixing in Europe. It had been widely trailed that the FIFA executive would sanction the use of two extra officials behind both goal lines in World Cup. But Blatter said that the finals in South Africa was too soon to introduce the system which has been used in the second-tier European club tournament this year. \"The experiments with the Europa League shall go on into the knockout stages next year but it has been decided, for the World Cup 2010, there is no change in the refereeing: one referee, two assistants and a fourth official.\" He went on to say that there would be further investigation into both video technology and additional referees. \"We shall have a look at technology or additional persons and this shall be done by a committee but not the referees committee alone, it will be done by the football, technical and medical committees, too,\" he added. Ireland were denied a place in the finals by a goal that should have been disallowed because Henry used his hand to control the ball before setting up William Gallas to score the aggregate decider in the second leg in the Stade de France. Ireland subsequently launched two appeals, the first for the match to be replayed, the second for them to be added to the line-up for the finals as the 33rd team. Both have been rejected, but Blatter was forced to apologize to the Irish for making public their supposedly private bid to be included as an extra team. Blatter put their request into the public domain in light-hearted comments made in Johannesburg, which left Irish football officials infuriated and insulted. \"I would like to express my regrets for the wrong interpretation of what I said. I regret what I have created and I'm sorry to the Ireland football confederation for these headlines going around the world,\" he said. \"It's a pity I communicated in this way. Sorry again.\"\n",

            "(CNN)  -- This Twitter thing has been coming on like gangbusters. The messaging site has been around for a couple of years, but its popularity seems to have exploded just recently. A self-admitted tech geek, Chris Pirillo is president of Lockergnome.com, a blogging network. Everyone from BarackObama to John Cleese to NASA to the consulate of Israel has a Twitter account. Heck, even yours truly does! Do you? Follow me and I'll follow you back. Twitter is really more of a social commons than a full-blown social network like MySpace or Facebook. It pretty much does one thing: allows people to \"tweet\" what they're up to (or what they're thinking about) in 140 characters or less. Call it micro-blogging, if you will, but it's about as close to the \"Keep It Simple, Stupid\" (K.I.S.S.) ideal as it gets. People can follow your tweets and you can follow theirs -- that's pretty much it. There are some third-party apps out there that can help you organize and seek out the information flying around out there in the Twittersphere, but it all pretty much stays in the nutshell. With the overwhelming amount of widgets and gadgets and gizmos and doohickeys and whatnots attached to every other social network out there, isn't it nice to be able to get away with plain ol' simple every now and again? Since we're sticking with the \"less is more\" aesthetic, I'm just going to give you 10 Twitter tips instead of the 20 I could have stretched this into. You're welcome! 1. Be yourself, but beware. Say whatever you feel like saying, but remember that whatever you write could exist in the digital universe forever. Proceed with extreme caution. 2. Don't be afraid to interact with others. If you like something they say, reply by clicking the little grey arrow that appears when you hover over one of their tweets. You can also simply type in @username (replacing \"username\" with whatever their username happens to be on Twitter). This is the formal way to address someone on Twitter. iReport.com: Do you agree with these tips? Share some of yours 3. Follow celebrities. They may never interact with you, but at least you can interact with them. It's no longer a question of who is on Twitter -- but who ISN'T on Twitter. 4. Use Twitter from your desktop. Twitter has something called an API (Application Programming Interface), which allows programmers to create experiences around Twitter for the community. Because of this, there have been an amazing array of applications released that will allow you to manage your Twitter account easily. There's Twitterrific, TweetDeck, and Twhirl -- just to name a few. 5. Find friends fast. If you're looking for new friends, a quick search for some of your favorite things on search.twitter.com will quickly reveal who you should be friending on Twitter. Maybe they'll follow you back? 6. Follow government officials. If your elected official isn't on http://tweetcongress.org, then they're behind the times. Heck, even the Library of Congress is on Twitter! 7. Crowdsource. If you have an idea, or a question, don't hold it in -- let it be known to all! Who knows -- someone just may answer your call for help. 8. Tweetups. Keep your eye out for these things. They're meetups for people on Twitter, and there's likely one happening regularly in your neck of the woods. I've taken to hosting one monthly in the Seattle area, as a matter of fact. Meet Twitter people -- tweeps, tweeple -- in meatspace! 9. Retweet. If you like something that someone else has tweeted, you can \"RT\" (retweet) it. This gives the original person credit, and also lets your followers know what you like. That's community! 10. Go with the flow. If you think you know better than everybody else, you're wrong -- the\n",

            "(CNN)  -- Thousands of fans, many weeping, packed a Hannover, Germany, stadium Sunday to pay their last respects to Robert Enke, captain of the Hannover 96 soccer club, who died last week in what police believe was a suicide. Footage from the event showed Enke's flower-bedecked coffin carried through the stadium to the accompaniment of Bette Midler's song \"The Rose\" as the crowd cheered. Many of the spectators waved Hannover 96 banners as they wiped tears from their eyes. Enke, 32, was the goalkeeper for both Hannover 96 and the German national soccer team. He died Tuesday about 6:25 p.m. after he apparently stepped in front of a train. He had played in eight games for the team and was widely expected to be the German team's goalkeeper in the 2010 World Cup. \"Preliminary police investigations indicate a suicide,\" Hannover 96 spokesman Stefan Wittke said last week. The stadium funeral service followed another memorial in a church and a mourning march through Hannover initiated by fans, the team said in a statement on its Web site. \"Robert's wife Teresa has expressed the wish to have all his friends and fans of her deceased husband bid farewell to him in the AWD Arena,\" the statement said. \"Hannover 96 supports Teresa Enke in her wish to have Robert and his friends, fans and teammates part with one another in an appropriate and worthy setting.\" \"A few days have passed since Robert's tragic death, but our inner shock remains,\" the team said. \"One thing is certain: We are not alone in our sadness. Robert Enke was not only perceived by you as a successful football player but above all as a special human being.\" Funeral speakers included German football league president Theo Zwanziger, the team said, as well as team chairman Martin Kind and other dignitaries. Afterward, the team said Enke would be laid to rest \"in the presence of (his) closest family members.\" Teresa Enke told reporters following Enke's death that her husband had been battling depression for six years, but had kept his condition from being public knowledge. He left a suicide note, she said. The Enkes' biological daughter, Lara, died in 2006 at the age of 2 from a heart condition. The couple recently had adopted an 18-month-old girl they named Leila. \"I tried to be there for him, said that football is not everything,\" Teresa Enke said. \"There are many beautiful things in life. It is not hopeless. \"We had Lara, we have Leila,\" she said. \"I always wanted to help him get through it. He didn't want (the depression) to come out because of fear. He was scared of losing Leila.\" Have you lost a loved-one to suicide?

In the wake of Enke's death, the German national soccer team canceled its friendly match with Chile on Saturday. Hannover 96 is currently 10th in Germany's Bundesliga top division. Enke had been capped by his national side eight times since making his debut at age 29.

Somalis prepare Monday to bury murdered Osman Ali Ahmed, the head of the U.N. Development Program. The first fatality was a Somali, Mohamed Mohamud Qeyre. He was the deputy director of the group Daryeel Bulasho Guud (DBG), funded by a German company and affiliated with the group Bread for the World. Qeyre was shot in the Somali capital of Mogadishu Friday night in what appeared to be a targeted attack, the reports said. He was shot by three gunmen outside the facility where aid distribution is coordinated. The gunmen may have been staking out the facility waiting for Qeyre to exit. The head of DBG, in Nairobi, Kenya, said he will suspend all aid operations in Somalia for the time being. The second fatality was a member of the Sodra nongovernmental organization, which is helping with humanitarian efforts in Somalia. Officials said it appears that Ali Baashi was also specifically targeted by gunmen. Earlier this week, the World Food Program said a truck driver carrying its relief supplies was killed -- the fourth WFP driver killed in Somalia this year. Ahmed Saalim was shot when fighting broke out between convoy escorts and militiamen at a checkpoint, the U.N. aid agency said. A growing percentage of the Somali population has become dependent on humanitarian aid. A severe famine swept the nation in 1991-1993, devastating crops, killing up to 280,000 people and displacing up to 2 million, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. The situation has been exacerbated by drought, continual armed conflicts in central and southern Somalia and high inflation on food and fuel. Journalist Mohamed Amin contributed to this report.\n",

            "(CNN)  -- Three protesters scaled the Golden Gate Bridge Monday and unfurled a \"Free Tibet\" banner, a likely precursor to large protests when the Olympic torch arrives Wednesday in San Francisco, California. Members of Students for a Free Tibet climbed the bridge to place these banners, said the group's spokesman. The banner read, \"One World. One Dream. Free Tibet.\" Those who climbed cables from which the bridge is suspended are members of Students for a Free Tibet, said group spokesman Tenzin Dasang. The three were arrested along with four others at the site. All seven were charged with felony conspiracy and misdemeanor nuisance, said California Highway Patrol Officer Mary Ziegenbein. The climbers also were charged with misdemeanor trespassing.  Watch protesters and banner hung from bridge » The incident forced the closure of one northbound lane of the bridge. The climbers -- who were on the bridge for about three hours -- came down voluntarily about 1:15 p.m. (4:15 p.m. ET) after workers with the Golden Gate Bridge District began cutting down their banner, Ziegenbein said. Dasang said he has heard of many people planning to protest in San Francisco against China's human rights record. \"We want it to be peaceful. But it will be large,\" said Dasang, 22, during a phone interview in which he said he was near the bridge. \"I heard from Tibetans that now live all over the U.S. and even abroad who are coming here.\" The Olympic flame is on a 130-day journey that will take it through 23 cities on five continents and then throughout China, culminating at the Olympics opening ceremony in Beijing August 8. The San Francisco protest comes the same day as a demonstration in Paris, France, disrupted the torch relay many times. In Paris, police had to cut the Olympic torch relay short Monday amid protests against China's human rights record, French police said. The torch was scheduled to travel 17 miles, past Paris City Hall, but that stop and others were called off after the protests. The torch made it through about 10 miles of its scheduled journey. It was then driven by bus to its final destination, where it was displayed again during a public ceremony at a stadium. Authorities had to play hide-and-seek with the Olympic torch during much of the route, placing it on a bus at least twice during a sometimes chaotic relay route. China has come under international criticism because of its crackdown last month on protesters calling for democratic freedoms and self-rule in Tibet and neighboring Chinese provinces. Protesters have said more than 100 people have died in the crackdown, but Beijing denies that and has accused supporters of the Dalai Lama of orchestrating the violence. U.S. and other Western leaders have called on China to provide civil rights and freedoms to those in Tibet and to enter peaceful discussions aimed at resolving the crisis.  E-mail to a friend\n",

Willard Boyle, left, and George Smith handle a charge-coupled device in 1974. Charles K. Kao, a British and U.S. citizen, won for \"groundbreaking achievements concerning the transmission of light in fibers for optical communication.\" Willard S. Boyle, a Canadian and U.S. citizen, and George E. Smith, a U.S. citizen, \"invented the first successful imaging technology using a digital sensor, a CCD (Charge-Coupled Device).\" Kao in 1966 \"made a discovery that led to a breakthrough in fiber optics. He carefully calculated how to transmit light over long distances via optical glass fibers,\" the academy said in a press release. Today, \"optical fibers make up the circulatory system that nourishes our communication society\" and \"facilitate broadband communication such as the Internet,\" the academy said. Boyle and Smith's Charge-Coupled Device -- invented in 1969 -- \"is the digital camera's electronic eye\" and paved the way for digital photography. \"It revolutionized photography, as light could now be captured electronically instead of on film. The digital form facilitates the processing and distribution of these images. CCD technology is also used in many medical applications, e.g. imaging the inside of the human body, both for diagnostics and for microsurgery.\" The Nobel Prizes are being awarded this week and next.

            "(CNN)  -- Tiger Woods apologized on Wednesday for \"transgressions\" that \"let his family down.\" \"I have let my family down and I regret those transgressions with all of my heart. I have not been true to my values and the behavior my family deserves,\" he said in a statement on his official Web site. \"I am not without faults and I am far short of perfect. I am dealing with my behavior and personal failings behind closed doors with my family. Those feelings should be shared by us alone.\" Woods made the comments in a statement posted on his Web site the same day that a gossip magazine published a story alleging that Woods had an affair with a 24-year-old New York cocktail waitress. The nightclub hostess, identified by a supermarket tabloid as Tiger Woods' mistress had called allegations that she is romantically involved with the golf superstar false and \"ridiculous.\" In an interview published Tuesday, Rachel Uchitel told The New York Post that a disgruntled acquaintance sold the story to the National Enquirer and that \"not a word of it is true.\" \"I work in clubs, and I am a businesswoman,\" Uchitel said. \"I do not have sex with celebrities, and I have not had an affair with Tiger Woods.\" Speculation has swirled around Woods since a wreck outside his Florida home early Friday left him with minor injuries and a citation for careless driving. The Florida Highway Patrol said Tuesday that its citation closes its investigation of the crash. Woods was not required to talk to state police about the wreck and did not sit for an interview with investigators. He issued a statement Sunday saying he alone was responsible for the crash and denouncing \"the many false, unfounded and malicious rumors that are currently circulating about my family and me.\" Opinion: Woods is only human The 33-year-old golf phenomenon has won the Masters tournament and the PGA tournament each four times, as well as three U.S. Open titles. Investigators have said they don't have details on why Woods was driving away from his home at such an early hour. A police report says the wreck was not alcohol-related. Uchitel said she has met Woods twice, once in her capacity as the VIP director at a club in Manhattan's trendy Meatpacking District and another time through a mutual friend. \"That's my job: to know these people, to have a relationship with them, to hang out with them,\" she told the Post. \"It doesn't mean I am having sex with them or an affair with them.\" She said the allegations \"must feel horrible\" to Woods' wife, Elin Nordegren. \"The worst part of it, it's not true,\" Uchitel said.\n",

            "(CNN)  -- Tillakaratne Dilshan scored his sixth Test century of a remarkable year to give Sri Lanka a fine start to the third match of their series against India in Mumbai on Wednesday. Dilshan made 109 as Sri Lanka, seeking a win to level the series at 1-1, closed on 366 for eight wickets on the opening day. All-rounder Angelo Mathews was closing on his first Test century with an unbeaten 86 on a wicket offering turn and bounce, but was rapidly running out of partners to the second new ball. India, who won the second Test in Kanpur last week by a crushing innings and 144 runs, will take over from South Africa as the top-ranked Test team in the world if they can win the series 2-0. Off-spinner Harbhajan Singh claimed four victims and slow left-armer Pragyan Ojha two but Dilshan proved a formidable opponent. He continued his superb 2009 with 10 boundaries and two sixes to reach three figures for the 11th time in Tests. He made 112 in the high-scoring draw in the first Test in Ahmedabad. Dilshan put on 93 in 20 overs for the first wicket with Tharanga Paranavitana, who made 53.before becoming Harbhajan's first victim just before lunch. India claimed three wickets in the afternoon as Sri Lankan captain Kumar Sangakkara went cheaply with Mahela Jayawardene adding 59 for the third wicket before falling victim to paceman Shanthakumaran Sreesanth. Harbhajan had Thilan Samaraweera caught in the leg-trap for one just before the tea interval. Mathews and Dilshan put Sri Lanka back on top again in the final session with a 74 stand which was ended when the opener was given out caught at short-leg off Harbhajan, with TV replays indicating he was unlucky. Prasanna Jayawardene made 43 in a sixth-wicket stand of 67 with Mathews, but he Nuwan Kulasekara and Rangana Herath fell in quick succession as India hit back again.\n",

            "(CNN)  -- To guard against public indifference to climate change the United Nations has enlisted a coalition of the world's leading advertising agencies. The world in their hands: New campaign aims to empower public. Leading up to the U.N. Climate Change Conference (COP15) in Copenhagen in December, the global \"Hopenhagen\" campaign has been unveiled. The initiative is aiming to generate active interest and persuade the public into believing they have a say in the negotiations between world leaders that will ratify a new global climate treaty. \"Climate change is one of the epic challenges facing this and future generations. World leaders will come together for the Copenhagen climate change conference in December, and every citizen of the world has a stake in the outcome. It is time to seal a deal. We need a global movement that mobilizes real change,\" said U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in a press statement. \"It is about global action for a global climate treaty and a better future for humankind.\" The campaign is a collaboration between a number of the world's largest communications companies. The strategy and creative concept for the Hopenhagen idea came from WPP's Ogilvy & Mather team; digital framework and direction were developed by MDC Partners' Colle+McVoy; and the global PR and messaging plans are spearheaded by Omnicom Group's Ketchum. Michael Lee, executive director of the International Advertising Association called the coalition of media companies involved \"unprecedented,\" adding that it was \"testament to the significance the industry places on the need for action to address climate change.\" According to the campaign brief, the aim is to change from the idea that we are just \"coping\" with global climate challenges to \"hoping\" and ultimately acting to combat the perils of climate change. The Hopenhagen Web site will be the center of an open source campaign where the public can send messages to the delegates of the UN summit meeting as well as raise awareness and debate issues. While the Web site will be developed as the months go by, the IAA also hopes that businesses, governments and NGOs engage in the campaign as well to create a broad global community with shared goals. Unveiled at the Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival this week, the first elements of the campaign can be seen at New York's JFK International, LA International and London Heathrow airports. From September a more \"aggressive\" consumer launch of the campaign will commence until the conference begins on December 7. What do you think? Does climate change need to be branded to keep us engaged? Are we in danger of \"climate change\" fatigue? Have your say in the Sound Off box below.\n",

            "• While Toyota is basing its current recall on the possibility of floor mat entrapment and sticky accelerator pedals, many factors can contribute to the problem of sudden unintended acceleration in vehicles.

            "\n",
            "• Recalls due to incidents of sudden unintended acceleration are not limited to the big five manufacturers. According to the NHTSA database, recalls have also been issued for vehicles made by Nissan, BMW, Volkswagen, Mitsubishi, Subaru, Mercedes-Benz, Kia, Mazda, Land Rover, Suzuki and Volvo. \n",

            "(CNN)  -- Two former Blackwater employees have made statements against Blackwater Worldwide and its founder Erik Prince, accusing the security company and its former CEO of murder and other serious crimes in Iraq, according to court documents filed this week. Blackwater founder Erik Prince, shown here before a congressional panel in 2007, recently left the company. The sworn affidavits by an ex-Marine who joined Blackwater and another employee -- listed in the documents as \"John Doe No. 1\" and \"John Doe No. 2\" -- are part of a civil lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Virginia against Prince on behalf of Iraqi families who say they lost loved ones at the hands of his company. Blackwater, recently renamed Xe, issued a statement Tuesday, saying it would respond \"to the anonymous unsubstantiated and offensive assertions put forward by the plaintiffs,\" in a brief to be filed August 17. The company had a security contract for operations in Iraq under the U.S. State Department until May, when the federal government declined to renew the contract. The decision did not affect other contracts Blackwater has with the State Department, a senior State department official told CNN earlier this year. Several of the plaintiffs are connected to a September 2007 shooting incident in Baghdad in which the Iraqi government says security guards, then employed by Blackwater, fired upon and killed 17 Iraqi civilians. The affidavits by the two witnesses, who did not want to be identified in the court documents filed Monday for fear of retaliatory \"violence,\"  paint a menacing portrait of Prince, who recently resigned from his company. \"First, he views himself as a Christian crusader tasked with eliminating Muslims and the Islamic faith from the globe. ... Second, Mr. Prince is motivated by greed,\" says John Doe No. 2. \"He sought every opportunity to deploy men to Iraq in order to earn more money from the United States government.\" He refers to another incident when he \"first arrived in Baghdad\" in which he saw fellow employees pulling weapons out of a shipment of dog food -- the allegation being smuggling. John Doe No. 1 describes witnessing one incident in Baquba, where a Blackwater employee allegedly fired into a passing single-passenger vehicle without provocation. He says he's heard of similar instances of excessive or deadly force from other Blackwater employees. However, neither gives clear details about the incidents they describe, such as specific dates or locations. The court documents filed Tuesday are in response to a defense motion to dismiss the suit. The suit says the affidavits were also submitted to the Justice Department, which is engaged in an ongoing investigation into the Blackwater case. No criminal charges have been filed against Prince. \"It is obvious that Plaintiffs have chosen to slander Mr. Prince rather than raise legal arguments or actual facts that will be considered by a court of law. We are happy to engage them there,\" the company statement said. \"We question the judgment of anyone who relies upon and [reiterates] anonymous declarations.\" Earlier this year, five former Blackwater security guards pleaded not guilty to federal charges of manslaughter and other serious crimes stemming from a September 16, 2007, shooting. Their trial is set for February 2010.\n",

            "(CNN)  -- Two former presidents reflected on their greatest regrets in office Monday, each looking back to issues that continue to plague the nation years later. Former presidents and political rivals Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush now share philanthropic efforts. Former Presidents George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton appeared together at a question-and-answer forum before the National Automobile Dealers Association in New Orleans, Louisiana. Asked his biggest regret after leaving office, Bush said he now wonders whether he should have tried to get Saddam Hussein to leave office at the end of the first Gulf War in 1991. He told the gathering, \"I've thought a lot about it, but at the end of Desert Storm, the question was should we have kind of kept going on that road to death and all this slaughter until Saddam Hussein showed up and laid his sword on the table, surrendered. And the common wisdom was he wouldn't do that.\" But he said a conversation with an FBI agent who interrogated Saddam after he was captured has made him reconsider. Bush recalled their talk, \"I said, 'What if we just say he has to come to surrender, would he have done it?' And this guy said, 'I'm absolutely convinced he would have.' My experts tell me he wouldn't have.\" Bush said, \"We ended it the way we said we would\" as a military success, but noted a cleaner ending \"would have been perfect.\" He added, \"If we had tried to get Saddam Hussein to come and literally surrender and put his sword on the table, I think it might have been avoided some of the problems that we did have in the future from him.\" On a day that President Barack Obama dispatched George Mitchell to the Middle East as the latest U.S. envoy, Clinton discussed the failure to achieve peace between Israelis and Palestinians. \"My No. 1 regret is that I was not able to persuade Yasser Arafat to accept the peace plan I offered at the end of my presidency that the Israelis accepted. \"If he had done that ... we had had seven years of progress toward peace. We had one year in 1998, the only year in the history of Israel where not a single soul was killed in a terrorist act. The Palestinians had more control over West Bank then than they do today,\" Clinton said. \"And if he had taken that deal, we would have a Palestinian state and we would have had, I think now, normal peaceful relations with Israel and all of its Arab neighbors.\" Clinton said a deal would have helped the U.S. handle other issues in the region, saying, \"We'd be much better positioned to deal with the problem of Iran, and we would have taken away about half the arguments of terrorists around the world by giving the Palestinians their state and creating a cooperative, positive interdependence in the Middle East, not a negative one. And so, I think that would have done more good to save more lives and help more people, and I wish I had been able to do that. \" Clinton also said he regretted not doing more to \"stop the Rwandan genocide,\" and succeeding on a new health care plan. He said \"presidents should share freely ... the mistakes they made\" with historians, because it teaches lessons. He said he shared problems during the lunch with Obama and the four living presidents, saying, \"You want each new president to make new mistakes, not the same ones.\" Clinton added, \"all of us know if you make enough decisions, you're going to make a few of them aren't right.\"\n",

One of the injured officers is taken out of an ambulance and rushed into the University of Louisville Hospital. Vincent Windell, 22, and another man whose name was not released were in custody in connection with Thursday's shooting, Jeffersonville, Indiana, Chief Detective Charlie Thompson told CNN. A third suspect, Robert Dattilo, 37, fled into Kentucky, where Louisville police were pursuing him, according to Louisville Metro Police spokeswoman Alicia Smiley. The incident began Thursday when Jeffersonville Police Cpl. Dan Lawhorn, 39, and Patrolman Keith Broady, 32, responded to a call from a Motel 6 employee about possible drug activity, Thompson said. The two were apparently ambushed when they arrived, Indiana State Police told the Louisville Courier-Journal. Lawhorn, an 11-year veteran, was shot in the leg, and Broady, a 4-year veteran, was shot in the upper body, Thompson said. The two officers returned fire, but it wasn't clear whether the suspects were hit. Lawhorn and Broady were able to reach their patrol cars and call for help after the shooting. They were rushed to the University of Louisville Hospital for surgery and are both listed in serious but stable condition, hospital spokesman David McArthur told CNN.\n",

            "(CNN)  -- Two of the biggest stars in the NBA will be team-mates next season after a blockbuster trade which sees Shaquille O'Neal move from the Phoenix Suns to the Cleveland Cavaliers -- the home of league MVP LeBron James. Shaquille O'Neal is hoping his arrival will put a smile on the faces of Cleveland fans. The 37-year-old O'Neal is one of the all-time greats of basketball, winning four NBA championships, three straight with the Los Angeles Lakers and the other with Miami Heat. James is widely recognized as the sport's current superstar, but the 24-year-old has been left frustrated by Cleveland's failure to win the title. He stormed off the court after  their loss to the Orlando Magic in the Eastern Conference finals, not even shaking hands with 2008 Olympic teammate Dwight Howard. The trade, which sees Phoenix get center Ben Wallace and guard Sasha Pavlovic, has been talked about since February but finalized on Thursday night. \"I was elated about the trade because I get to play with one of the greatest players to ever play the game in LeBron James,\" O'Neal was quoted on the NBA's official Web site www.nba.com. O'Neal averaged 17.8 points and 8.4 rebounds in 75 games for the Suns last season and believes he still has much to offer the NBA. \"My numbers are not good enough to retire. Three more years left,\" O'Neal wrote on his Twitter blog. His career averages are 24.7 points, 11.3 rebounds and 2.4 blocked shots, with his peak seasons coming as he led the Lakers to three straight titles from 2000-02. The Lakers traded him to Miami where he spent three seasons, helping them to the NBA Championship three years ago. He has played in Phoenix for the past two years, restricted by injuries in his first season. The Cavs, powered by James, won 66 regular season games and their first eight in the playoffs before coming unstuck against the Magic. They will be hoping that O'Neal will be the final piece in the jigsaw to land the first American sports championship for Cleveland in 45 years.\n",

            "(CNN)  -- Two people were found dead and a third person is still believed missing in a North Carolina food plant heavily damaged in a morning explosion, police said Tuesday night. Part of a collapsed ConAgra Foods plant lies atop parked cars Tuesday in Garner, North Carolina. Four people were in critical condition after the explosion at the ConAgra Foods plant in the town of Garner, CNN affiliate WRAL-TV reported. The explosion, reported about 11:30 a.m. Tuesday, caused sections of the roof to collapse. Search efforts for those missing were slowed by ammonia leaks and a fire that was not extinguished until afternoon. \"There was no warnings, no signs,\" Garner Mayor Ronnie Williams said. \"It all happened very abruptly.\" At least 38 people were transported to area hospitals, said Jeff Hammerstein, district chief for Wake County Emergency Medical Services. Four burn victims -- two males and two females -- were undergoing critical care at the North Carolina Jaycees Burn Center, said Dr. Charles Cairns, director of emergency medicine for UNC Hospitals. The patients suffered burns that covered from 40 to 60 percent of their bodies, Cairns said. Police said recovery workers still were trying to get the two bodies out of the plant, which makes Slim Jim food products. The victims' names weren't immediately available. More than 300 people were in the plant when the explosion happened, authorities said. The cause of the blast was unknown, according to Garner police spokesman Joe Binns. Rescuers were crawling into the rubble -- sometimes in pockets of space less than 30 inches tall -- in attempts to access the two bodies and find the missing person, officials said at a news conference Tuesday night. The search crews were moving slowly in part because the building is very unstable, officials said. Video from the scene showed holes in sections of the roof of the 425,000 square-foot plant. First responders set up a makeshift triage area near the building. A section of the roof was collapsed, and pipes could be seen spewing liquid believed to be ammonia.  Watch liquid spew from building » ConAgra Foods' brands include Healthy Choice, Chef Boyardee and Orville Redenbacher, among others. The Garner plant is known for producing Slim Jim beef jerky products. The company was \"working with authorities on the ground to ensure that their employees are getting all of the support that they need,\" said Stephanie Childs, ConAgra director of corporate communication. \"The employees' health is their only real concern at this time.\" Gail Ruffin, a ConAgra worker who was in the plant when the explosion happened, told WRAL she heard a boom. \"The ceiling start coming down, and we all start running,\" Ruffin, who wasn't injured, told WRAL. \"Everyone was trying to get to the exit door. ... I was just trying to get out, and then we just [saw] people that [were] burned -- blood all over them.\" Garner is seven miles south of Raleigh.\n",

Smoke from the explosion of a truck carrying fireworks rises over Ocracoke Island, North Carolina, Saturday. Jamie Tunnell, Hyde County spokeswoman, said the fireworks were to be used for the annual Fourth of July show on Ocracoke Island, and the five people were members of the crew setting up the display. The truck exploded at the Ocracoke Island docks. One person was killed at the scene, while another died at a hospital from injuries sustained in the blast, Tunnell said. Emergency crews and firefighters arrived. Tunnell said two volunteer firefighters were being treated for smoke inhalation and exhaustion. Joseph Chestnut, 16, was working at the Ride the Wind kayak-rental stand in Ocracoke when he heard the explosion across the harbor. He thought a home under construction had collapsed, he told CNN's iReport. iReport.com: Smoke rises from explosion site \"I saw all these fireworks blowing up,\" he said. \"They were low, and I knew that something was wrong.\"  Watch images from the scene » \"It was just really scary.

As of 10 a.m. Friday (2 a.m. GMT), wind gusts were reaching 112 mph, and Morakot, a medium-strength typhoon, was moving west-northwest at 14 mph en route to landfall, the agency said. Already, mudslides and landslides were occurring on the land, as airlines canceled flights, and government offices, schools and the Taiwan Stock Exchange closed for the day, according to Taiwan's Central News Agency. The storm was centered about 124 miles (200 km) southeast of Taipei and could wind up directly over the capital, said CNN meteorologist Kevin Corriveau. He predicted its impact would be massive. \"This storm has already dumped about 400 millimeters (16 inches) of rain in the central and southern part of the island, and they're still expecting another 500 (20 inches) to 800 millimeters (32 inches) of rain over the next 24 to 48 hours,\" he said.

            "(CNN)  -- Two people were killed and three others were in critical condition Saturday when a truck carrying fireworks on North Carolina's Outer Banks exploded, officials said. Smoke from the explosion of a truck carrying fireworks rises over Ocracoke Island, North Carolina, Saturday. Jamie Tunnell, Hyde County spokeswoman, said the fireworks were to be used for the annual Fourth of July show on Ocracoke Island, and the five people were members of the crew setting up the display. The truck exploded at the Ocracoke Island docks. One person was killed at the scene, while another died at a hospital from injuries sustained in the blast, Tunnell said. Emergency crews and firefighters arrived. Tunnell said two volunteer firefighters were being treated for smoke inhalation and exhaustion. Joseph Chestnut, 16, was working at the Ride the Wind kayak-rental stand in Ocracoke when he heard the explosion across the harbor. He thought a home under construction had collapsed, he told CNN's iReport. iReport.com: Smoke rises from explosion site \"I saw all these fireworks blowing up,\" he said. \"They were low, and I knew that something was wrong.\"  Watch images from the scene » \"It was just really scary. There's never been an accident like that before that I've seen here,\" Chestnut added. The Hatteras Island ferry service was temporarily suspended, but had reopened by midday, and Highway 12 was clear, she said. The island, which is part of the Cape Hatteras National Seashore, can be reached only by ferry, private boat or plane. The FBI and the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives were going to investigate on Saturday, she said.\n",
